## IPTV Configuration

Now that your app is activated, it's time to set up your IPTV service:

1. On the [https://nohtv.shop/setup](https://nohtv.shop/setup) page, you'll see two options:
    - Enter IPTV Subscription Information
    - Upload M3U Playlist File

After completing either option, the app on your VR headset will automatically sync with the new IPTV information.

## Troubleshooting
